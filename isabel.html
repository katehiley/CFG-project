                <p>Healthtech Entrepreneur
                Doctor in Engineering Sciences, Biomedical Engineering & Materials Sciences, Biomaterials & Medical Implants (PhD)
                Master of Science in Electro-Mechanical Engineering (MSc)
                Bachelor of Science in Applied Sciences & Engineering (BSc)</p>
                
               <p>Following a long neurorehabilitation period Isabel went through herself due to a work accident in 2010, she decided to start Immersive Rehab in September 2016. The aim of Immersive Rehab is to create neurorehabili­tation exercise­s in Virtual Reality that improve patient recovery and reduce referral times­, to make rehab fun and engaging­, and to have a better patient outcome.</p>
                
               <p>Isabel is an experienced healthcare technology innovator, product strategist & manager, scientist/academic, product designer, experimentalist, and collaborator across disciplines. She is passionate about science, healthcare technologies, digital health, immersive technologies (VR/AR) and its applications in healthcare, using tech for good, social entrepreneurship, and promoting women in science & tech.</p></div>

              <h4>About Immersive Rehab</h4>
                <p>Immersive Rehab creates interactive & engaging digital neuro-rehabilitation programmes in Virtual Reality with the aim to improve patient recovery. The goal is to increase the effectiveness of neurorehabilitation, to reduce referral times­, to make rehab fun and engaging­, and to have a better patient outcome.</p>
                <p>Immersive Rehab is all about improving the outcome for patients going through neurorehabilitation and giving them more of their independence back. Physical and Neuro-rehabilitation is often not an accessible, engaging and motivating activity to embark upon and engagement with and long term compliance can be a limiting factor in relation to treatment success. Stroke patients and people with limited mobility in upper limbs for example often cannot engage with physical objects during physical rehab due to lack of strength which slows down their recovery process, as well as being very demoralising.</p>
                    <p>It is important to offer people access to effective physical and neuro-rehabilitation exercises and to keep people engaged into their physical and neuro-rehabilitation programme as this is key in their recovery process. If patients can see and have progress quantified it can provide positive reinforcement thereby preventing patients from becoming demoralised by their condition. They also have limited access to follow-up rehab once up and walking while still having a very limited upper limb mobility. Research has shown that retraining the brain can lead to important gains in mobility. We believe that immersive Virtual Reality can impact this significantly.</p>
