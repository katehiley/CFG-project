                <p>CEO Bumble
                    Whitney Wolfe Herd has had a massive hand in the way many women date and network today. Back in 2014, she launched the app Bumble, which empowers women to make the first moves in both love and business. Fast-forward to 2021, and she’s now the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire at 31. But she’s had setbacks, sexual harassment lawsuits and more to contend with on her way to the top.</p>
                
               <p> Wolfe Herd first came on the scene as a co-founder and VP of Marketing at Tinder, where she helped grow the dating app into one of the world’s biggest dating platforms. But after a lawsuit over sexual harassment and discrimination, which was settled out of court, Wolfe Herd left the company to build an app focused on compliments and positive affirmations.

                Originally, she wanted nothing to do with the dating space. But after meeting Andrey Adreev, Badoo founder and Bumble’s majority stakeholder, she realized that giving women a voice in digital dating could be revolutionary. And so, Bumble was born in 2014.
              </p>
                
               <p>  The app has grown to 30 million users, and continues to grow in popularity based on a simple premise: women make the first move.
                
                But Wolfe Herd’s ambitions don’t stop at dating. The 28-year-old founder has added new verticals to the app, letting users find friends and make professional connections via Bumble.
                
                And all the while, Bumble’s cap table has never changed, with Wolfe Herd’s 20 percent stake as yet undiluted. Wolfe Herd was named one of Time 100’s most influential people this year, and has herself become a brand that represents authenticity and self-empowerment.</p></div>

              <h3>5 Facts about Whitney</h3>
             <h4>1. She’s a former Tinder executive</h4>
                 <p>  
                    In 2012, Wolfe Herd started working for the Match Group MTCH, -1.27% dating app Tinder, known for its leftward and rightward swipes. She says she came up with the name “Tinder.”
                    
                    She was vice president of marketing at Tinder during a period of huge user growth for the platform among young people.
                    
                    Wolfe Herd left the company in 2014 and later filed a lawsuit against Tinder for sexual harassment — she received over $1 million plus stock as part of a settlement, according to reports. </p>
              <h4>2. Bumble IPO made her a billionaire on paper</h4>
                <p>Bumble’s market reception has made Wolfe Herd’s 21.5 million shares worth over $1 billion.

                    Of the 500 wealthiest people in the world, fewer than 5% are self-made women, according to Bloomberg.
                    
                    Wolfe Herd was seen with her baby in a video marking Bumble’s debut on the Nasdaq.</p>
                <h4>3. She became the youngest female CEO to take a company public</h4>
                <p>At 31, Wolfe Herd is the youngest female CEO ever to lead a company to an IPO, according to Business Insider.

                    In the past year, 560 companies have gone public, and Bumble is just the third among them with a female founder and eighth with a female CEO. Additionally, over 70% of the members on Bumble’s board are women, according to its SEC filing.
                    
                    “Hopefully this will not be a rare headline,” Wolfe Herd told Bloomberg of Bumble’s being a female-led company. “Hopefully this will be the norm. It’s the right thing to do, it’s a priority for us, and it should be a priority for everyone else.”</p>
                <h4> 4. She invested in another dating app called Chappy</h4>
                <p>In 2016, Bumble and Wolfe Herd invested in a dating app called Chappy. The app was designed for gay men in the U.K. 

                    In 2020, the app was shut down and a merger with Bumble announced.</p>
                <h4> 5. She championed legislation that made digital sexual harassment a crime</h4>
                <p>Wolfe Herd, who attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas and whose company is headquartered in Austin, was a driving force for Texas legislation, signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in 2019, that made sending lewd photographs without permission a crime in the state.

                    The legislation made such acts a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine up to $500. Wolfe Herd testified in front of the Texas House Criminal Jurisprudence committee on the subject.
                    
                    “It is time that our laws mirror this way we lead double lives, in the physical and the digital,” Wolfe Herd said. “You look at government right now, it only protects the physical world. But our youth are spending a lot more time in the digital world than they are in the physical.”</p>
